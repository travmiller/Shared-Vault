# 01 World Building

## Spiritual Foundations

### The Ancestral Tether
The Teurek tribe's core belief revolves around a mystical connection between the living and the dead. This "spiritual tether" binds each shaman to a lineage of ancestral spirits, forming an unbroken chain of wisdom and power stretching back through time.

### The Ritual of Bonding
On the cusp of adulthood, potential shamans undergo the Ritual of Bonding. This sacred rite forges the initial connection between a young Teurek and their ancestral guide. The ritual involves:

1. A days-long fast to purify the body and mind
2. Consumption of a potent, hallucinogenic brew derived from rare cave fungi
3. A trance-like state where the initiate's consciousness travels to the spirit realm
4. The first meeting with their ancestral guide, marking the beginning of their shamanic journey

### The Nature of Ancestral Spirits
Ancestral spirits are not mere echoes of the past, but evolving entities shaped by the collective experiences of their lineage. They can:

- Ancestral Spirits are ostensibly there to provide guidance and warnings to the Teurek Tribe, but there is nothing inherently tying them to this motive.
- The Ancestral Spirits are immortal and able to time travel
- Many of the Ancestral Spirits are roughly 100 years old
- Each ancestral spirit ostensibly represents one clan of the Teurek tribe. Although after nearly 100 years, many of the Ancestral Spirits have grown bored and disinterested in the ongoings of the Teurek Tribe

## Societal Structure

### Clan System
The Teurek tribe is divided into clans, each represented by a unique sacred symbol and tied to a specific ancestral spirit.

#### Sacred Symbols
- Abstract, geometric designs passed down through generations
- Serve as spiritual anchors and visual representations of clan identity
- Used in rituals, tattooed on bodies, and woven into clothing

#### Clan Membership
- Primarily determined by paternal lineage
- Can be altered through adoption, marriage, or rare cases of spiritual calling
- The Ritual of Transference allows outsiders to join a clan, involving:
  1. A period of study and preparation
  2. A ceremonial introduction to the clan's symbol and spirit guide
  3. A spiritual pledge to uphold clan traditions and responsibilities

### Social Hierarchy
1. Tribal Elders: A council of the oldest and most respected shamans
2. Clan Chiefs: Leaders of individual clans, often the most powerful shamans
3. Shamans: Spiritual leaders and mediators between the living and the dead
4. Warriors: Protectors of the tribe and enforcers of the elders' will
5. Craftsmen and Hunters: Vital contributors to the tribe's survival
6. Common Tribespeople: The backbone of Teurek society

## Magic and Shamanic Practices

### The Ritual of Preservation
Knowledge of The Ritual of Preservation is closely guarded secret known only to tribal elders of the Teurek tribe and select shamans. 

This ritual involves:

- The preservation of a shaman's consciousness after death as an immortal spirit
- The Spirit Guides of the Teurek tribe are shaman who have undergone the Ritual of Preservation
- For a shaman to undergo the Ritual of Preservation, they must be killed during the ritual
- Ethical concerns about the nature of this practice and its long-term effects

### Shamanic Magic
Teurek shamans can harness various magical abilities, including:

- Communing with nature spirits
- Healing rituals (often requiring sacrifices or exchanges)
- Weather manipulation (on a limited scale)
- Divination through bone casting or entrail reading
- Creating protective wards and talismans
- Supernatural ability to understand the body language of animals

All magic comes at a cost, often involving blood sacrifice, personal energy depletion, or bargains with spiritual entities.

## Cultural Elements

### Rites of Passage
1. Naming Ceremony: At birth, where a child receives their "spirit name"
2. First Hunt: Marking the transition from child to adolescent
3. Ritual of Bonding: For potential shamans
4. Warrior's Trial: For those seeking to join the warrior caste
5. Elder's Ascension: When a shaman is accepted into the council of elders

### Taboos and Superstitions
- Speaking the names of the dead (except during specific rituals)
- Crossing clan boundaries without permission or ritual cleansing
- Disrespecting or misusing clan symbols
- Sharing shamanic secrets with outsiders

### Art and Craftsmanship
- Intricate beadwork incorporating clan symbols
- Bone carving, especially for ritual objects
- Cave paintings depicting spiritual journeys and ancestral wisdom
- Textile weaving with patterns that hold hidden meanings

## The Wider World

### Neighboring Tribes
- View the Teurek with fear and suspicion due to their shamanic practices
- Occasional trade, but frequent border conflicts
- Some see Teurek magic as a form of necromancy or dark sorcery

### Environmental Challenges
- Harsh, unforgiving landscape (specifics depend on the chosen setting)
- Dwindling resources leading to increased inter-tribal conflict
- Mysterious phenomena possibly linked to ancestral spirits or time distortions

### Looming Threats
- An encroaching "civilization" that views shamanic practices as primitive and dangerous
- Environmental disasters potentially linked to misuse of time travel abilities
- Internal strife as some clan members question traditional practices and seek change

### Themes

This expanded world-building document provides a richer foundation for the grim-dark novel, offering numerous avenues for conflict, character development, and exploration of complex themes.

In this tribal culture, the spiritual leaders, or shamans have a spiritual tether to their ancestors, a lineage of spirits that guide them and provide wisdom from the past. On the eve of their shaman initiation, each young shaman to be undertakes a Ritual of Bonding to connect with their ancestral spirit for the first time.

The protagonist, Kai, has been eagerly awaiting this moment. But when his turn comes, he finds his ancestral spirit, Raik missingâ€”or so it seems. In his place is a strange man sitting in a desolate wasteland.

As Kai seeks to uncover the mystery of his 'absent' spirit, he finds he can still experience the past like others, but his journeys take him back to ancient, primal times when fantastical creatures roamed the earth, and magic was as common as air.

The tribe views Kai's anomaly as a bad omen and shuns him, except for a few who believe that his unique link might be a blessing rather than a curse. The tribal elders fear what this could mean and prohibit Kai from using his powers.

Undeterred, Kai continues to explore his abilities in secret, guided by the ancient spirit. He discovers he can influence these primal times, and his actions have ripple effects in the present day. He must navigate the tribal politics, understand his powers, and uncover his true lineage.

Throughout his journey, he's haunted by the question of his identity. Who is this strange spirit? Where was he transported in his vision? This could lead to a climactic revelation about Kai's true origin and the destiny he needs to fulfill.

This plot offers opportunities to explore themes of identity, belonging, the conflict between tradition and individuality, and the unintended consequences of meddling with 
the time. It also deals with themes of isolation, loneliness, boredom, and purpose. It also allows for some creative world-building in depicting the ancient, magical past and the desolate future Kai can access.
