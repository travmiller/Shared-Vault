            <p>I hesitated, torn between my instincts for self-preservation and the undeniable pull of the unknown. In the end, curiosity won out. I changed course, following the ethereal nudges that guided me deeper into a part of the forest I had yet to explore.</p>
<p>The terrain grew rougher, the underbrush thicker. I pushed through tangled vines and ducked under low-hanging branches, my hands and face scratched by thorns and rough bark. Just as I was beginning to think I had made a terrible mistake, the forest suddenly opened up before me.</p>
<p>I stood at the edge of a small clearing, bathed in dappled sunlight. At its center stood an ancient oak tree, its trunk so wide that it would have taken five men with outstretched arms to encircle it. But it wasn't the tree's size that took my breath away â€“ it was the symbols carved into its bark.</p>
<p>They were unlike anything I had ever seen in my shamanic studies. Spirals and angular lines intertwined, forming patterns that seemed to shift and change as I looked at them. And at the base of the tree, half-hidden by gnarled roots, was an opening.</p>
