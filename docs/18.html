            <p>The day passed in a haze of hunger and thirst. Though I had been trained in basic survival skills, actually putting them into practice proved challenging. My attempts at foraging yielded only a handful of berries and some edible roots, barely enough to quiet the gnawing in my stomach. Finding water proved easier, thanks to a small stream I encountered in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>As I knelt by the water's edge, cupping the cool liquid in my hands, I caught sight of my reflection. The face that stared back at me was a stranger's—gaunt, wild-eyed, marked with the ashen symbols of banishment. For a moment, I was overwhelmed by a wave of self-pity and despair.</p>
<p>"Why?" I whispered, my voice hoarse from disuse. "Why is this happening to me?"</p>
<p>But the forest offered no answers, and the presence that had so violently inserted itself into my life during the Bonding remained stubbornly silent.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set once more, I found myself at the base of a small cliff. A shallow cave, little more than an indentation in the rock face, offered some shelter from the elements. I gathered what dry wood I could find and, after several frustrating attempts, managed to coax a small fire to life.</p>
<p>The first light of dawn filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. I awoke with a start, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings. The events of the previous day came rushing back – the exile, the long walk into the wilderness, the fitful sleep in the shallow cave. My body ached from the hard ground, and the marks of banishment still itched on my skin.</p>
