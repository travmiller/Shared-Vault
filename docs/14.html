            <p>I looked to Erol, hoping for support, but he avoided my gaze. In that moment, I realized just how alone I truly was.</p>
<p>"You have until sunset to gather your belongings," Mera said, her voice softening slightly. "May the spirits guide you, Kai. And may you find the answers you seek."</p>
<p>As they turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of movement at the edge of the clearing. Lira stood there, her eyes wide with shock and sorrow. For a moment, our gazes locked, and I saw all the questions, all the hurt, all the things left unsaid between us.</p>
<p>Then she was gone, and I was left standing alone.</p>
<p>The weight of the council's decision settled over me like a shroud. Exile. The word echoed in my mind, each repetition hammering home the reality of my situation. I had until sunset – mere hours to say goodbye to the only life I'd ever known.</p>
<p>As I made my way back to my dwelling, the whispers in the village grew louder, no longer hushed in my presence. Faces that had once smiled warmly at me now turned away, fear and mistrust evident in their eyes.</p>
<p>"It's for the best," I heard one elder mutter. "We can't risk the safety of the entire tribe for one unstable shaman."</p>
<p>The words stung, but I couldn't deny the truth in them. I was a danger – to myself, to my people, to everything I held dear.</p>
