            <p>A soft knock at my door interrupted my melancholy. I opened it to find Erol standing there, his face a mask of sorrow and regret.</p>
<p>"Kai," he began, his voice heavy. "I... I'm sorry it's come to this."</p>
<p>I nodded, unable to find words. Erol had been more than a teacher – he'd been a second father. And now, like everyone else, he was slipping away.</p>
<p>"The exile ritual," Erol continued, clearing his throat. "It will take place at sunset, at the edge of the Spirit Grove. You... you should prepare yourself."</p>
<p>As Erol turned to leave, he hesitated. "Kai, whatever is happening to you... whatever you've seen or experienced... be careful. There are forces at work here that we don't understand."</p>
<p>With that cryptic warning, he was gone, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the ever-present whispers in my mind.</p>
<p>The hours seemed to blur together as I finished my preparations. As the sun began its descent towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and red, I made my way to the Spirit Grove. The entire tribe had gathered, their faces solemn.</p>
<p>Mera stood at the forefront, flanked by the other elders. In her hands, she held a small clay bowl filled with ash – the same ash used in the Bonding ritual. The irony was not lost on me.</p>
<p>"Kai, son of Joran," Mera's voice rang out, silencing the murmurs of the crowd. "You stand before us, no longer of our tribe. The spirits have spoken, and we must heed their warning."</p>
<p>She approached me, dipping her fingers into the ash. With swift, practiced movements, she drew symbols on my forehead, cheeks, and chest – marks of severance, of banishment.</p>
