            <p>Mera's words echoed in my mind long after she had left me standing at the village's edge. The weight of her gaze, filled with both concern and suspicion, seemed to linger in the air around me. I knew I couldn't keep up this charade forever, but the thought of revealing the truth filled me with a bone-deep terror.</p>
<p>As dawn broke, casting long shadows across the village, I made my way to Erol's hut for another day of training. The whispers followed me, a constant reminder of my growing isolation.</p>
<p>"Kai," Erol greeted me, his face a mask of forced neutrality. "Today, we'll attempt a journey to the spirit realm. A simple scouting mission, nothing more."</p>
<p>I nodded, my mouth dry. This was a fundamental skill for any shaman, a way to commune directly with the ancestral spirits. Without Raik's guidance, I was flying blind.</p>
<p>Erol began the ritual, burning sacred herbs and chanting in the old tongue. The smoke swirled around us, thick and cloying. I closed my eyes, trying to empty my mind as I'd been taught.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was nothing. Then, like a dam breaking, I felt myself pulled into that otherworldly landscape. The crimson sky churned overhead, and the barren plain stretched out before me. But this time, I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>Shadowy figures moved in the distance, their forms flickering and insubstantial. As I watched, one began to approach. Its features were indistinct, constantly shifting, but its eyes... its eyes were fixed on me with an intensity that made my soul quake.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" I managed to ask, my voice sounding hollow in this strange realm.</p>
<p>The figure didn't speak, but I felt its response reverberate through my being. <em>We are the forgotten. The discarded. The price of your tribe's... preservation.</em></p>
