            <p>We made our way to Erol's hut, a structure that always seemed larger on the inside than its exterior suggested. Bundles of herbs hung from the rafters, filling the air with a pungent, earthy scent. In the center, a small fire pit smoldered, tendrils of bluish smoke curling upwards.</p>
<p>"Today," Erol began, settling himself on a woven mat, "we'll attempt a simple communion. Nothing too taxing, just a way to open the channels between you and Raik."</p>
<p>My heart raced. This was it – the moment my deception would be exposed. I watched as Erol sprinkled a handful of dried leaves onto the embers. The smoke thickened, taking on a sweet, almost cloying scent.</p>
<p>"Breathe deeply," Erol instructed. "Let your mind empty. Feel for the tether that binds you to Raik."</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, inhaling the fragrant smoke. For a moment, there was nothing but the steady rhythm of my own heartbeat. Then, like a current tugging at my consciousness, I felt it – that same pull I'd experienced the night before.</p>
<p>Without warning, the world around me fell away. I stood once again on that barren plain, the sky above a churning sea of crimson. But this time, I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>A figure stood before me, tall and imposing. It wasn't the shadowed presence from my Bonding, but something... older. Ancient. Its form seemed to shift and waver, as if struggling to maintain coherence in this realm.</p>
<p>"You are not Raik," I managed, my voice barely a whisper.</p>
<p>The figure's response came not in words, but in a flood of images and sensations. I saw vast stretches of time, civilizations rising and falling like waves upon a shore. I felt the weight of countless lives, of knowledge accumulated over eons.</p>
