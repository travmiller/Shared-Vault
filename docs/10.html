            <p>"He's dangerous," I overheard one elder say to another as I passed. "Untrained, unpredictable. This is not how a proper Bonding should manifest."</p>
<p>Even my childhood friends began to distance themselves. All except Lira, who watched me with a mixture of concern and determination.</p>
<p>"Kai," she cornered me one evening as I was returning from another frustrating session with Erol. "What's really going on? This isn't like you."</p>
<p>For a moment, I was tempted to confess everything. But the memory of that ancient, terrible presence I'd encountered held me back. "I'm fine, Lira," I lied, hating myself for it. "It's just... taking some time to adjust."</p>
<p>She studied me, hurt flickering across her face. "You used to tell me everything, Kai. What changed?"</p>
<p>I couldn't meet her eyes. "Nothing. I just... I need to figure this out on my own."</p>
<p>As Lira walked away, I felt another piece of my old life slip through my fingers.</p>
<p>That night, unable to sleep, I crept to the edge of the village. The crimson sky of my vision haunted me, and I found myself scanning the horizon, half-expecting to see that alien landscape materialize.</p>
<p>"Trouble sleeping, young Kai?"</p>
<p>I whirled to find Mera, our tribe's matriarch, standing behind me. Her eyes, usually warm, were sharp with scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Just... restless," I managed.</p>
<p>Mera nodded slowly. "The weight of responsibility can be heavy, especially for one so young." She paused, her gaze piercing. "But secrets, Kai... secrets are heavier still."</p>
<p>My heart raced. Did she know? Had she somehow sensed the truth?</p>
<p>"I... I don't know what you mean," I stammered.</p>
<p>Mera's expression softened slightly. "Don't you? Kai, whatever burden you're carrying, remember that you're not alone. The tribe is here to support you. But we can only help if you let us in."</p>
