<h1>Chapter 1: The Ritual of Bonding</h1>
<p>"You're brooding again, young Kai," a familiar voice chided. I turned to find Erol, our tribe's shaman, his weathered face creased with a knowing smile. "The fire will still be there after you've rested."</p>
<p>I nodded, not trusting my voice. Erol had been more than a teacher these past years; he'd been a second father, guiding me through the labyrinth of shamanic lore. Now, on the eve of my Bonding, I found myself wishing for a few more years under his tutelage.</p>
<p>"Come," he said, placing a gnarled hand on my shoulder. "Walk with an old man."</p>
<p>We made our way through the village, past round houses with smoke curling from their chimneys. Faces peered out at us, some offering encouraging smiles, others averting their eyes quickly. I couldn't blame them. Tomorrow, I would either become one of the tribe's spiritual guardians or... well, no one spoke of the alternatives.</p>
<p>Erol led me to the edge of the Spirit Grove, a stand of ancient pines that had witnessed countless Bondings. At its heart stood the Binding Stone, a relic as old as our people. Even from here, I could feel its presence, a low thrum that vibrated in my bones.</p>
<p>"You know," Erol began, his voice taking on the cadence of a storyteller, "when I was your age, I was convinced I'd fail the Bonding."</p>
<p>I looked at him, startled. Erol, our powerful shaman, afraid? It seemed impossible.</p>
<p>He chuckled at my expression. "Oh yes. I spent the night before convinced that the spirits would reject me, that I'd bring shame to my family." He paused, his eyes distant. "But do you know what I realized, Kai?"</p>
<p>I shook my head, hanging on his every word.</p>
