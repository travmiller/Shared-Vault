            <p>I opened my mouth to lie, to fabricate some innocuous vision, but the words wouldn't come. Instead, I heard myself say, "The forgotten ones. They... they spoke to me."</p>
<p>Erol's face paled. He gripped my shoulders, his fingers digging in painfully. "Listen to me very carefully, Kai. You must not speak of this to anyone. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>The intensity in his voice frightened me more than the vision had. I nodded mutely.</p>
<p>"Good," Erol said, releasing me. "Go now. Rest. We'll... we'll continue tomorrow."</p>
<p>As I stumbled back to my dwelling, my mind reeled. The forgotten ones? The price of preservation? What could it all mean?</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the village became a minefield of suspicious glances and hushed conversations that fell silent as I approached. Even Erol seemed to be distancing himself, our training sessions growing shorter and more perfunctory.</p>
<p>It all came to a head one morning as I made my way to the sacred grove. A group of elders, including Mera, stood waiting for me. Their faces were grim, their postures tense.</p>
<p>"Kai," Mera said, her voice heavy with regret. "The council has made a decision. We believe it's best if you... take some time away from the village. To meditate, to gain control over these... unusual manifestations of your power."</p>
<p>"But..." I began, panic rising in my throat. "But I'm a shaman now. I'm bonded to Raik. You can't just..."</p>
<p>"Can't we?" one of the other elders cut in, his voice sharp. "You claim to be bonded, yet you show none of the signs. Your power is erratic, dangerous. You're a threat to the entire tribe."</p>
<p>I looked to Erol, hoping for support, but he avoided my gaze. In that moment, I realized just how alone I truly was.</p>
