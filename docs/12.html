            <p>Before I could question further, the vision shattered. I gasped, my eyes flying open to find Erol kneeling beside me, his face etched with worry and something else... fear?</p>
<p>"Kai," he said, his voice low and urgent. "What did you see?"</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to lie, to fabricate some innocuous vision, but the words wouldn't come. Instead, I heard myself say, "The forgotten ones. They... they spoke to me."</p>
<p>Erol's face paled. He gripped my shoulders, his fingers digging in painfully. "Listen to me very carefully, Kai. You must not speak of this to anyone. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>The intensity in his voice frightened me more than the vision had. I nodded mutely.</p>
<p>"Good," Erol said, releasing me. "Go now. Rest. We'll... we'll continue tomorrow."</p>
<p>As I stumbled back to my dwelling, my mind reeled. The forgotten ones? The price of preservation? What could it all mean?</p>
<p>That night, sleep eluded me once again. The whispering presence in my mind had grown stronger, more insistent. Images flashed behind my closed eyelids â€“ fragments of memories that weren't my own, glimpses of a world long past.</p>
<p>A soft knock at my door jolted me from my troubled thoughts. I opened it to find Lira, her face pale in the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Kai," she whispered, glancing nervously over her shoulder. "We need to talk."</p>
<p>I hesitated, torn between my longing for a confidant and the warning that still echoed in my ears. <em>You must not speak of this to anyone.</em></p>
<p>"Please," Lira said, her eyes pleading. "I know something's wrong. Let me help you."</p>
