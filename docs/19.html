            <p>I shook off the melancholy thoughts and focused on the task at hand. Food. Water. Shelter. These were the things that mattered now. Yet even as I tried to concentrate on survival, my mind wandered back to the life I'd left behind.</p>
<p>The day I was chosen for shamanic training surfaced in my memory. The pride I had felt, the eagerness to learn. My father's eyes shining with tears of joy, my mother embracing me tightly, whispering how proud she was. Now, I wondered if they were ashamed of me, if they regretted the day their son had been singled out as special.</p>
<p>As I wandered through the forest, half-heartedly searching for anything edible, the oppressive silence weighed heavily on me. Had it only been a day since I'd spoken to another person? It felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>Lira's face flashed in my mind, the hurt in her eyes when I'd pushed her away. She had always been there for me, through every triumph and setback in my training. How many times had she listened patiently as I rambled on about obscure spiritual theories or ancient rituals? And how had I repaid that loyalty? By shutting her out when I needed her most.</p>
<p>A part of me wanted to believe they were all better off without me. But even as the thought formed, I felt the ache of loneliness deep in my chest. I had always been something of an outsider in the village, set apart by my calling and my studies. But I had never felt truly alone until now.</p>
