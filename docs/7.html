            <p>"Who... what are you?" I asked, awe and terror warring within me.</p>
<p>The entity's form solidified for a moment, taking on a vaguely humanoid shape. Its eyes, if they could be called that, fixed upon me with an intensity that threatened to unmake me.</p>
<p><em>"We are the forgotten,"</em> a voice resonated in my mind, ancient and multifaceted. <em>"The ones your tribe cast aside in their quest for... preservation."</em></p>
<p>Before I could respond, the vision shattered. I gasped, my eyes flying open to find Erol leaning over me, concern etched on his face.</p>
<p>"Kai! Are you alright? You went rigid, and then..."</p>
<p>I struggled to sit up, my head pounding. "I... I'm fine," I lied, the taste of ashes on my tongue. "It was just... intense."</p>
<p>Erol helped me to my feet, his eyes searching mine. "What did you see? Did Raik speak to you?"</p>
<p>For a moment, I teetered on the edge of confession. But the memory of that ancient presence, of the weight behind its words, held me back. "It was... confusing," I said carefully. "I need time to process it."</p>
<p>Erol nodded, though I could see doubt creeping into his expression. "Of course, of course. Rest now. We'll try again tomorrow."</p>
<p>As I stumbled back to my dwelling, my mind reeled. The forgotten ones? Cast aside? What could it mean? And more pressingly, how long could I keep this charade going?</p>
<p>That night, sleep eluded me once again. The whispering presence was stronger now, a constant pressure at the edges of my consciousness. I tossed and turned, fragments of the vision replaying behind my closed eyelids.</p>
<p>A soft knock at my door startled me from my restless thoughts. I opened it to find Lira, my childhood friend, her face pale in the moonlight.</p>
