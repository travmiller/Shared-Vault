            <p>"Now," Erol continued, his voice low and soothing, "call to the spirits. Let them hear Raik's voice through you."</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, focusing on the strange presence I'd encountered during the Bonding. If I couldn't channel Raik, perhaps I could tap into... whatever that was.</p>
<p>For a moment, nothing happened. Then, like a bolt of lightning, something surged through me. The world exploded into vibrant colors and pulsing energies. I could sense every living thing around us, from the tiniest insect to the ancient trees.</p>
<p>"Kai?" Erol's voice seemed to come from very far away. "Kai, what do you see?"</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, gasping. The vivid sensations faded, leaving me disoriented and shaken. "I... I'm not sure," I managed. "It was overwhelming."</p>
<p>Erol studied me, his brow furrowed. "Hm. It seems Raik's power is... potent in you. Perhaps too potent for such a simple exercise." He paused, stroking his beard thoughtfully. "We'll try something else tomorrow. For now, rest. Meditate on what you experienced."</p>
<p>I nodded, grateful for the reprieve. But as I walked back to the village, I could feel Erol's eyes on me, filled with a mixture of concern and... suspicion?</p>
<p>The next few days fell into an uneasy pattern. Each morning, I would join Erol for training, and each morning, my attempts at shamanic abilities would yield unexpected and often alarming results. Plants would wither at my touch when I tried to heal them. Attempts at divination left me babbling in languages I didn't understand.</p>
<p>Word spread quickly through the village. Some viewed my erratic powers with awe, whispering that Raik must have blessed me with extraordinary gifts. Others were not so kind.</p>
