            <p>The ceremony began, a blur of chants and ritual movements. Erol's steady presence anchored me as Mera traced ancient symbols on my brow with the silvery-red ashes. The world seemed to hold its breath as she raised the box to my lips.</p>
<p>I inhaled deeply, the ashes searing a path down my throat. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the world exploded into light and shadow.</p>
<p>I stood in a vast, barren plain, the sky above me a churning sea of crimson. Before me burned a fire, its flames moving with impossible slowness. And across that fire sat a figure, his features obscured by shadow and flame.</p>
<p>"Raik?" I whispered, my voice seeming to echo across the desolate landscape.</p>
<p>The figure remained motionless, save for the slightest tilt of his head. In that small movement, I sensed curiosity, evaluation... and something else. Loneliness?</p>
<p>I took a step forward, drawn by an impulse I couldn't name. "I... I don't know if I'm worthy," I said, the words spilling out unbidden. "But I want to learn. To grow. To serve our people."</p>
<p>The figure's posture changed, almost imperceptibly. Then, slowly, he extended a hand towards me. As our fingers touched, the world exploded once more.</p>
<p>I gasped, my eyes flying open to find myself back in the Spirit Grove. The tribe watched in tense silence as Mera studied my face. Then, a smile broke across her weathered features.</p>
<p>"The binding is complete," she announced. "Raik has accepted Kai as his vessel."</p>
<p>Erol's hand on my shoulder brought me back to the present. His eyes searched mine, a flicker of concern crossing his face. "Kai? Are you alright?"</p>
