            <p>But the forest offered no answers, and the presence that had so violently inserted itself into my life during the Bonding remained stubbornly silent.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set once more, I found myself at the base of a small cliff. A shallow cave, little more than an indentation in the rock face, offered some shelter from the elements. I gathered what dry wood I could find and, after several frustrating attempts, managed to coax a small fire to life.</p>
<p>The first light of dawn filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. I awoke with a start, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings. The events of the previous day came rushing back â€“ the exile, the long walk into the wilderness, the fitful sleep in the shallow cave. My body ached from the hard ground, and the marks of banishment still itched on my skin.</p>
<p>I shook off the melancholy thoughts and focused on the task at hand. Food. Water. Shelter. These were the things that mattered now. Yet even as I tried to concentrate on survival, my mind wandered back to the life I'd left behind.</p>
<p>The day I was chosen for shamanic training surfaced in my memory. The pride I had felt, the eagerness to learn. My father's eyes shining with tears of joy, my mother embracing me tightly, whispering how proud she was. Now, I wondered if they were ashamed of me, if they regretted the day their son had been singled out as special.</p>
<p>As I wandered through the forest, half-heartedly searching for anything edible, the oppressive silence weighed heavily on me. Had it only been a day since I'd spoken to another person? It felt like an eternity.</p>
