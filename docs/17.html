            <p>I walked until the glow of the village fires was nothing more than a memory, my feet carrying me deeper into the forest that had always marked the boundary of our lands. The same trees that had once seemed welcoming and full of life now loomed ominously, their branches reaching out like gnarled fingers in the pale moonlight.</p>
<p>As the adrenaline of the exile ceremony wore off, exhaustion began to set in. My legs trembled with each step, and my mind reeled with the enormity of what had transpired. I was alone—truly alone—for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>Finding a small clearing, I sank to the ground, my back against a large oak. The night air was cool, carrying with it the first hints of autumn. I pulled my meager blanket around my shoulders, but it did little to ward off the chill that seemed to emanate from within.</p>
<p>Sleep eluded me that night. Every snapping twig or rustle in the underbrush sent my heart racing, my mind conjuring images of predators—both animal and spirit—lurking in the shadows. But worse than the sounds were the moments of silence, when the weight of my isolation pressed down upon me like a physical force.</p>
<p>As the first light of dawn began to filter through the canopy, I rose, my body stiff and aching. The marks of exile itched on my skin, a constant reminder of all I had lost. With no clear destination in mind, I simply began to walk, letting instinct guide my steps.</p>
