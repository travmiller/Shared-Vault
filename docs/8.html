            <p>"Kai," she whispered, glancing nervously over her shoulder. "I need to talk to you. It's about... it's about the Bonding."</p>
<p>I teetered on the edge of confession. Lira had been my confidante since childhood. If anyone would understand, it would be her.</p>
<p>"Lira," I heard myself say, my voice oddly calm, "I appreciate your concern. But I assure you, everything is fine.</p>
<p>The words felt like ash in my mouth, each one a betrayal of our friendship. Lira's face fell, confusion and hurt flickering across her features.</p>

<h1 id="heading-1">Chapter 2: Seeds of Suspicion</h1>
<p>The dawn after my Bonding brought no clarity, only a deepening sense of unease. As I emerged from my dwelling, the village bustled with its usual morning activities, but I felt disconnected from it all, as if viewing the world through a veil.</p>
<p>"Kai!" Erol's voice cut through my reverie. "Come, it's time for your first lesson as a full shaman."</p>
<p>I followed him to the sacred grove, my stomach churning with anxiety. How could I possibly fake the abilities I was supposed to have gained?</p>
<p>Erol settled cross-legged before the Binding Stone, gesturing for me to join him. "Today, we'll start with something simple. Communion with the lesser spirits of the forest."</p>
<p>I nodded, trying to mask my panic. In theory, this was a basic skill, one I should have mastered years ago. But without Raik's guidance, without the true Bonding... I was lost.</p>
<p>"Close your eyes," Erol instructed. "Reach out with your mind. Feel the pulse of life around you."</p>
<p>I did as he said, desperately hoping for some spark of intuition, some hint of the power I was supposed to possess. But there was nothing â€“ only the whisper of wind through leaves and the distant call of a bird.</p>
