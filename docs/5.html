            <p>As Mera walked away, guilt gnawed at me. I was alone – more alone than she could possibly know. Whatever had happened during my Bonding, I couldn't shake the feeling that speaking of it would bring disaster.</p>
<p>That night, as the village slept off the celebrations, I lay awake, staring at the shadows on my ceiling. The expectations of my tribe weighed heavily upon me. They believed I'd connected with Raik, that I was now a conduit for his ancestral wisdom. How long could I maintain that illusion?</p>
<p>As if in answer to my unspoken question, a voice whispered at the edge of my consciousness. It wasn't words, exactly, but a feeling – a pull towards... something. The voice of the spirit I'd encountered?</p>
<p>The first rays of dawn crept through the gaps in my dwelling, painting patterns on the earthen floor. I hadn't slept. The whispering presence at the edge of my mind had grown neither louder nor clearer, but its persistence was maddening. It felt like a splinter lodged in my thoughts, impossible to ignore yet maddeningly difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>I rose, my body aching from the previous day's ritual. Outside, the village stirred to life, smoke rising from cookfires as the Teurek prepared to face another day. For them, life continued as it always had. For me, everything had changed.</p>
<p>"Kai!" Erol's voice cut through my brooding. He approached, his face alight with anticipation. "How do you feel? Has Raik spoken to you yet?"</p>
<p>The lie came easily, too easily. "Not... not clearly," I said, forcing a sheepish smile. "It's all still a bit overwhelming."</p>
<p>Erol nodded sagely. "Ah, yes. It can take time for the connection to solidify. But come, it's time for your first lesson as a true shaman."</p>
