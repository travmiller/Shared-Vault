            <p>For a moment, I teetered on the edge of confession. But then I saw the fear in Erol's eyes, heard the urgency in his voice. Whatever was happening to me, it was dangerous â€“ not just to me, but to everyone around me.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Lira," I heard myself say, my voice sounding distant and cold. "There's nothing to talk about."</p>
<p>The hurt that flashed across her face was like a physical blow. Without another word, she turned and disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>As I closed the door, I felt the last threads of my old life slipping away. I was alone now, truly alone, with nothing but the whispers of the forgotten to keep me company.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the village became a minefield of suspicious glances and hushed conversations that fell silent as I approached. Even Erol seemed to be distancing himself, our training sessions growing shorter and more perfunctory.</p>
<p>It all came to a head one morning as I made my way to the sacred grove. A group of elders, including Mera, stood waiting for me. Their faces were grim, their postures tense.</p>
<p>"Kai," Mera said, her voice heavy with regret. "The council has made a decision. We believe it's best if you... take some time away from the village. To meditate, to gain control over these... unusual manifestations of your power."</p>
<p>The words hit me like a physical blow. Exile. They were exiling me.</p>
<p>"But..." I began, panic rising in my throat. "But I'm a shaman now. I'm bonded to Raik. You can't just..."</p>
<p>"Can't we?" one of the other elders cut in, his voice sharp. "You claim to be bonded, yet you show none of the signs. Your power is erratic, dangerous. You're a threat to the entire tribe."</p>
