            <p>I opened my mouth to speak, to tell him about the crimson sky and the silent figure, but something held me back. A warning, perhaps, or an instinct I couldn't explain. Instead, I nodded, forcing a smile. "Yes, I... it was overwhelming."</p>
<p>Erol's brow furrowed for a moment, but then he broke into a wide grin. "It often is, my boy. Come, the tribe is eager to welcome its newest shaman."</p>
<p>The next few hours passed in a blur of congratulations and ritual. I went through the motions, accepting blessings and gifts, but my mind kept drifting back to that barren plain. Who – or what – had I encountered? And why had it accepted me in Raik's place?</p>
<p>As the celebration wound down, I found myself once again at the edge of the Spirit Grove. The Binding Stone stood silent, offering no answers to my unspoken questions.</p>
<p>"Heavy thoughts for such a joyous day," Mera's voice startled me from my reverie. The matriarch approached, her eyes kind but probing.</p>
<p>I straightened, trying to mask my unease. "Just... processing everything," I managed.</p>
<p>Mera studied me for a long moment. "The Bonding affects each of us differently," she said finally. "Some find instant connection, others... well, it can take time to fully understand the bond you've formed."</p>
<p>I nodded, grateful for the explanation that aligned so neatly with my behavior. "How will I know when I've... fully connected?"</p>
<p>A ghost of a smile played at Mera's lips. "You'll know, Kai. The spirits have their own ways of making themselves heard." She placed a hand on my arm, her touch surprisingly warm. "Trust in the bond, young one. And remember, you're not alone in this journey."</p>
