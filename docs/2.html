            <p>"The spirits don't seek perfection. They seek potential. The willingness to learn, to grow, to serve." He turned to me, his gaze piercing. "And that, young Kai, you have in abundance."</p>
<p>His words warmed me, but the chill of doubt remained. "But what if... what if Raik doesn't accept me?"</p>
<p>Erol's expression softened. "Raik has guided our people for generations. But remember, Kai, he too was once young, once uncertain. The bond between shaman and spirit is not about worthiness, but about harmony."</p>
<p>We stood in silence for a moment, the wind whispering through the pines. Finally, Erol spoke again. "Now, off to bed with you. Tomorrow will come soon enough."</p>
<p>As I made my way back to my family's house, Erol's words echoed in my mind. Harmony, not worthiness. I clung to that thought as I drifted into an uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>Dawn broke, painting the sky in hues of amber and rose. The village stirred to life, an undercurrent of excitement running through the air. My mother helped me don the ceremonial robes, her hands steady even as her eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p>
<p>The walk to the Spirit Grove felt both endless and far too short. The entire tribe followed, their footsteps a rhythmic counterpoint to the beating of my heart. At the Binding Stone, Mera, our tribe's matriarch, waited with Erol. Between them sat a small, intricately carved box - the vessel containing Raik's sacred ashes.</p>
<p>Mera's voice rang out, clear and strong. "Today, we witness the Bonding of Kai, son of Joran, heir to the legacy of Raik."</p>
