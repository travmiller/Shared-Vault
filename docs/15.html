            <p>Back in my hut, I began the solemn task of packing. What does one take when leaving behind their entire world? I gathered my few personal belongings – a carved bone amulet from my father, a small pouch of sacred herbs, a well-worn blanket. Each item I touched seemed to hold a lifetime of memories, making the reality of my exile all the more painful.</p>
<p>A soft knock at my door interrupted my melancholy. I opened it to find Erol standing there, his face a mask of sorrow and regret.</p>
<p>"Kai," he began, his voice heavy. "I... I'm sorry it's come to this."</p>
<p>I nodded, unable to find words. Erol had been more than a teacher – he'd been a second father. And now, like everyone else, he was slipping away.</p>
<p>"The exile ritual," Erol continued, clearing his throat. "It will take place at sunset, at the edge of the Spirit Grove. You... you should prepare yourself."</p>
<p>As Erol turned to leave, he hesitated. "Kai, whatever is happening to you... whatever you've seen or experienced... be careful. There are forces at work here that we don't understand."</p>
<p>With that cryptic warning, he was gone, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the ever-present whispers in my mind.</p>
<p>The hours seemed to blur together as I finished my preparations. As the sun began its descent towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and red, I made my way to the Spirit Grove. The entire tribe had gathered, their faces solemn.</p>
<p>Mera stood at the forefront, flanked by the other elders. In her hands, she held a small clay bowl filled with ash – the same ash used in the Bonding ritual. The irony was not lost on me.</p>
