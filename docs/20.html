            <p>As the sun climbed higher in the sky, I finally managed to find a small patch of berries. They were tart and not particularly filling, but they quieted the worst of the hunger pangs. As I ate, I couldn't help but think of the feasts back in the village â€“ the smell of roasted meat, the laughter and conversation around the communal fires.</p>
<p>I had never appreciated those moments enough, I realized. I had always been too focused on my studies, too eager to prove myself worthy of my calling. How many shared meals had I rushed through, my mind already on the next lesson or ritual? How many conversations had I missed, too absorbed in my own thoughts to truly listen?</p>
<p>The weight of those missed opportunities settled over me. I slumped against a tree trunk, suddenly exhausted despite the early hour.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, I found myself retracing the steps that had led me to this point. Every decision, every choice that had seemed so clear and righteous at the time, now felt hollow and misguided.</p>
<p>The countless hours I'd spent in meditation, seeking connection with the spirits, now seemed futile. Had any of it been real? Or had I simply deluded myself, seeing patterns and meaning where there was only randomness and void?</p>
<p>The sun began to set, casting long shadows through the trees. I made my way back to the cave, my feet dragging with each step. The short journey had exhausted me, both physically and emotionally.</p>
