            <p>On this particular morning, I awoke to a chill in the air that hadn't been there before. Autumn was deepening its grip on the land, and I knew that soon, the forest's already meager offerings would become even scarcer. I needed to find a more permanent shelter, to gather supplies for the coming winter. The thought filled me with a mixture of dread and determination.</p>
<p>As I set out from my makeshift camp, a familiar pressure began to build at the edges of my consciousness. The presence that had haunted me since my failed Bonding stirred, more insistent than it had been in days. I tried to ignore it, focusing instead on the practical concerns of finding food and water. But with each step, the whispers grew louder, more coherent.</p>
<p><em>This way,</em> they seemed to say, tugging at the corners of my mind. <em>Come this way.</em></p>
<p>I hesitated, torn between my instincts for self-preservation and the undeniable pull of the unknown. In the end, curiosity won out. I changed course, following the ethereal nudges that guided me deeper into a part of the forest I had yet to explore.</p>
<p>The terrain grew rougher, the underbrush thicker. I pushed through tangled vines and ducked under low-hanging branches, my hands and face scratched by thorns and rough bark. Just as I was beginning to think I had made a terrible mistake, the forest suddenly opened up before me.</p>
<p>I stood at the edge of a small clearing, bathed in dappled sunlight. At its center stood an ancient oak tree, its trunk so wide that it would have taken five men with outstretched arms to encircle it. But it wasn't the tree's size that took my breath away â€“ it was the symbols carved into its bark.</p>
