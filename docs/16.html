            <p>"Kai, son of Joran," Mera's voice rang out, silencing the murmurs of the crowd. "You stand before us, no longer of our tribe. The spirits have spoken, and we must heed their warning."</p>
<p>She approached me, dipping her fingers into the ash. With swift, practiced movements, she drew symbols on my forehead, cheeks, and chest – marks of severance, of banishment.</p>
<p>"With these marks, we sever your ties to the Teurek," Mera intoned. "May they protect you on your journey and remind you of the home that once was yours."</p>
<p>One by one, the elders approached, each adding their own marks to my skin. Some muttered prayers, others warnings. Erol was the last, his hands trembling slightly as he completed the ritual.</p>
<p>"Remember your training," he whispered, his eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. "And trust your instincts."</p>
<p>As the last rays of sunlight faded from the sky, Mera raised her voice once more. "Kai, you are now exiled from the Teurek. You may not return unless called back by the council. May the spirits guide your path."</p>

<h1 id="heading-1">Chapter 3: Exile</h1>
<p>The last echoes of Mera's words faded into the gathering darkness as I turned my back on everything I had ever known. The weight of the ceremonial ashes on my skin felt like chains, binding me to a fate I neither understood nor wanted. With each step that took me further from the village, the whispers of my tribe—once so familiar and comforting—grew fainter, replaced by the rustling of leaves and the call of night birds.</p>
