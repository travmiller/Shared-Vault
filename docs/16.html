            <p>Finding a small clearing, I sank to the ground, my back against a large oak. The night air was cool, carrying with it the first hints of autumn. I pulled my meager blanket around my shoulders, but it did little to ward off the chill that seemed to emanate from within.</p>
<p>Sleep eluded me that night. Every snapping twig or rustle in the underbrush sent my heart racing, my mind conjuring images of predators—both animal and spirit—lurking in the shadows. But worse than the sounds were the moments of silence, when the weight of my isolation pressed down upon me like a physical force.</p>
<p>As the first light of dawn began to filter through the canopy, I rose, my body stiff and aching. The marks of exile itched on my skin, a constant reminder of all I had lost. With no clear destination in mind, I simply began to walk, letting instinct guide my steps.</p>
<p>The day passed in a haze of hunger and thirst. Though I had been trained in basic survival skills, actually putting them into practice proved challenging. My attempts at foraging yielded only a handful of berries and some edible roots, barely enough to quiet the gnawing in my stomach. Finding water proved easier, thanks to a small stream I encountered in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>As I knelt by the water's edge, cupping the cool liquid in my hands, I caught sight of my reflection. The face that stared back at me was a stranger's—gaunt, wild-eyed, marked with the ashen symbols of banishment. For a moment, I was overwhelmed by a wave of self-pity and despair.</p>
<p>"Why?" I whispered, my voice hoarse from disuse. "Why is this happening to me?"</p>
